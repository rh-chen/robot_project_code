# map sampling factor-> The chance of getting proper room configuration depends on this value ------> in [m]
# 1. choice of value is very important
# 2. slightly large value will give better sampled map
# 3. Extra large value will cost more computation time
# 4. large value is needed for big map
# 5. small value is needed for small map

# room area factor-> Set the limitation of area of the room -------> in [m]
# 1. choice of value is very important
# 2. smaller value increase the chance to get every room
